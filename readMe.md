This is A superbook socail network project 
base on the guide lines and best practices of this book:
-------------------------------------------------
Django Desing Patterns and Best Practices 
-------------------------------------------------

this is one of the best books i have read on Django framework 

this books starts  with you from how django framework works, up to how to delpoy a django project 

in each chapter it discus best practices and design pattern related to this part of the application or the framewrok 

you will learn everything you need to know about django framework that you will never see in a single course or tutorial explaining them this way. 

-- 
I highly recommend that every django developer must read and study this book carefully more than once and practice writting the code alongside. 

You will be astonished of the author experience  and expertise
-- 
the source code is written in django 2.* but there is no problem at all to follow along as the changes between django 2 and 3 are very little
